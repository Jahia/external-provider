External Provider UI
======================

This is a legacy UI module to integrate Jahia External Provider in your site using Spring Webflow.
This module is NOT part of the Jahia distribution.

Spring features are deprecated and we encourage developers to use OSGi to handle the EDP registration.and React + GraphQL + Content editor to build a custom UI.

## Open-Source

This is an Open-Source module, you can find more details about Open-Source @ Jahia [in this repository](https://github.com/Jahia/open-source).
